# Workflow for finding network placement

## Part one: Loading data

1. Load data for all children with all ages for those children
1.1 filter for child ID

2. Load matrix of distance between words for lexical index (phonology, semantic etc.) (Dem tilde laver)
2.1.Make adjacency matrix by using ifelse on relationship matrix:  ifelse(matrix >= limit, 1, 0) (by using a cutoff)
2.2 Filter the matrix so only words learned at t1 remains: ifelse(matrix %in% list_of_t1_words, 1, 0)
2.3 Remove all words with no edges

3. Find all words in that is learned at t2
3.1a if the word is already in the matrix, do a calculation of centrality
3.1b.1 if the word isn't already in the matrix, calculate all edges for that vertic: 
edges <- get_colnames(
    for_row_that_is_word_at_t2(
        filter(value == 1)
    )
)

igraph::add_vertice(word_name, edges)

3.1b.2 Insert that vertic in the network.
3.1b.3 do calculation of centrality for that matrix.
