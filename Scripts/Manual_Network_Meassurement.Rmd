This is where we manually do the magic??! ;)

```{r}
# Load packages, and download if not locally stored
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, igraph)
```


# Single out a child, and a timepoint
```{r}
# Read dataset
Words_known_for_child <- read.csv("../Data/75kidsubset.csv")
```
```{r}
# Create vector of all child ID's
Unique_Child_IDs <- unique(Words_known_for_child$child_id)

# For child N in list filter for only first timepoint
N <- 1 # The child we want to investigate
filtered_Words_for_child <- Words_known_for_child %>% 
    filter(child_id == Unique_Child_IDs[N]) %>% #Only pick the N'th child
    filter(age == min(age))

## Test to check filtering worked correct:)
# filtered_Words_for_child %>% 
#     select(age, child_id) %>% 
#     unique
```
```{r}
filtered_Words_for_child %>% 
    mutate(er_det_ens = comprehension/production) %>% 
    select(comprehension,production) %>% 
    unique

Words_known_for_child %>% 
    select(comprehension) %>% 
    unique()
```
